## Detailed Report
This README file serves as a brief introduction to the project.
**[The complete exploration and report can be accessed here](https://jamesinjune.github.io/Epidemiology_of_Suicide/).**

## Project Overview
This exploration aims to investigate patterns and trends in suicide rates from 2006-2019 across the world, as well as their correlation to the measured happiness of a country. We also examine how these differ by age and sex within countries, as well as on a global scale through the use of various interactive visualizations. The goal is to further our understanding of suicides around the world in order to find out how different groups are affected and guide our search in finding better solutions.

### Tools Used
- Python (pandas) - [Data cleaning process](https://github.com/jamesinjune/Suicide_Rates_Exploration/tree/main/notebooks)
- SQL Server - [Data querying/wrangling process](https://github.com/jamesinjune/Suicide_Rates_Exploration/blob/main/suicides_queries_views.sql)
- Tableau - Interactive visualizations

## Dataset
The [final dataset](https://github.com/jamesinjune/Suicide_Rates_Exploration/blob/main/final_visualization_data/Suicides_Rates_Happiness_datasets.xls) used combines suicide rate data categorized by country, sex, and age group, with various happiness measures of a country.

- Suicides and population [raw data](https://github.com/jamesinjune/Suicide_Rates_Exploration/tree/main/raw_data) were taken from IHME's [VizHub data tool](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/).
- Happiness Index [raw data](https://github.com/jamesinjune/Suicide_Rates_Exploration/blob/main/raw_data/DataForTable2.1WHR2023.csv) was taken from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/data/) from 2023, a report by the United Nations that rates happiness per country through various measures.

## Key Findings
- **Suicide rates generally rise with age**, but this can vary by country.
- **Men generally experience higher rates than women.**
- Suicide rates have generally been on a downward trend, having **fallen by over 27\% between 2006-2019**. When looking at specific countries and age groups, however, this can vary.
- **Happiness, GDP per capita, and healthy life expectancy** seem to **play larger roles in affecting suicide rates for the elderly**.
- The happiness of a country is **not a predictor, but rather a factor** in affecting suicide rates.
