									<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
									<p>This exploration aims to investigate patterns and trends in suicide rates from 2006-2019 across the
										world, as well as their correlation to the measured happiness of a country. We also examine how
										these differ by age and sex within countries, as well as on a global scale. The goal is to further our
										understanding of suicides around the world in order to find out how different groups are affected
										and guide our search in finding better solutions.</p>

								</div>
							</section>
								
							<section id="suicides_dataset">
								<div class="container">
									<h3>2.1 Suicides Dataset</h3>
									<p>A dataset of total suicides split by age groups and sex was acquired using IHME’s <a href="https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/">VizHub</a> data
										tool with data from their Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. A dataset of the corresponding
										populations split by the same criteria was also acquired from the same tool. These datasets were
										then cleaned and merged into one large dataset, and crude suicide rates per 100,000 population were
										calculated per each population, which is the standard for population measures.</p>
									<p>The population and suicide counts are estimates based on upper and lower bounds provided by
										the dataset. For the sake of simplicity, those columns were dropped in the final merged dataset (see
										Section 4.2).</p>
										<p>Age groups were split by 5-year gaps:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>10-14 years</li>
										<li>15-19 years</li>
										<li>20-24 years</li>
										<li>...</li>
										<li>80-84 years</li>
										<li>85+ years</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Age groups were broken up as such to provide insight into suicide rates at specific developmental
										stages. The small age-ranges allow for greater granularity and more freedom in exploring the role of
										age in suicides. Data was unavailable for ages under 10. All suicide rates, crude and age-standardized
										in this report are per 100,000 population.</p>
									<p>Ages 85+ were chosen as the ceiling because the populations of age groups 90+ were simply too
										small, leading to less reliability and precision.</p>
									<p>Additionally, estimated suicide counts that were less than 1 were filtered out as well to reduce sta-
										tistical noise/outliers. Previously, somehow some countries had estimated suicide counts of less than
										0.001, leading to extreme outliers in suicide rates. This may raise justified concerns regarding poor
										data quality, which are acknowledged; however, there are few datasets that are this comprehensive,
										so we will attempt to minimize this during the data cleaning process.</p>

									<h3>2.2 Happiness Index Dataset</h3>
								<p>The dataset for measuring happiness was taken from the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/data/">World Happiness Report</a> from 2023, a
									report by the United Nations that rates happiness per country through various measures. In short,
									we have:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Cantril life ladder (Happiness score): </b>Score from 0-10 of how good your life is at the
										current moment.</li>
									<li><b>Log GDP (PPP) per capita: </b>A measure of average income and living standards per person,
										factoring in differences in the cost of living between countries. The logarithm is taken to
										facilitate easier comparison between countries.</li>
									<li><b>Social support: </b>Binary response to whether or not you have friends or family to rely on. A higher score indicates better social support.</li>
									<li><b>Life expectancy at birth: </b>How long (in years) a newborn is expected to live.</li>
									<li><b>Freedom to make life choices: </b>Binary response to whether you have enough freedom in choosing how to live your life. A higher score indicates more freedom.</li>
									<li><b>Generosity: </b>How much a country's actual behavior of donating money to charity deviates from what would be predicted based on its GDP per capita. A positive value indicates greater charity than expected, and vice versa.</li>
									<li><b>Perceptions of corruption: </b>Binary response to whether government is perceived corrupt and whether businesses are perceived corrupt. A higher score indicates higher perception of corruption.</li>
									<li><b>Positive affect: </b>The amount of laugh, enjoyment, and interesting things experienced, averaged.</li>
									<li><b>Negative affect: </b>The amount of worry, sadness, and anger experienced, averaged.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>A full appendix for a detailed explanation of each measure can be accessed 
									<a href="https://happiness-report.s3.amazonaws.com/2023/WHR+23_Statistical_Appendix.pdf">here</a>. 
									The World Happiness Report assigns a value to each field by averaging nationwide responses to these 
									questions. The dataset begins from 2005, and data is collected on a yearly basis. Unfortunately, the 
									happiness dataset is not age-standardized, so we have to assume that some of the more subjective 
									measures above apply to all ages.</p>

									<h3>2.3 The use of crude versus age-standardized mortality rates</h3>
									<p>It is important to note that we are not calculating the crude death rates for each age group
										and sex split in the suicides dataset. As countries sometimes have vastly differing age distributions,
										comparing crude rates of countries as a whole leads to inaccuracies. Therefore, we circumvent this
										by calculating age-standardized mortality rates using the 
										<a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/gho-documents/global-health-estimates/gpe_discussion_paper_series_paper31_2001_age_standardization_rates.pdf">
										WHO’s World Standard Population (page 12)</a>. A detailed guide on how to calculate it can be found 
										<a href="https://www3.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2012/PAHO-Age-standardized-mortality-rates-2009.pdf">here</a>.</p>
									<p>The WHO World Standard Population provides a distribution for all ages, starting from age 0
										to 100+. However, as our dataset only contains data for ages 10+, we must adjust and normalize
										the weights to conform to our needs. We can do this by:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Combining the age groups in the World Standard Population distribution into the groups we
											are using by summing the weights (i.e. 95-100 years and 100+ years → 95+ years).</li>
										<li>Normalizing the resulting list of weights.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>This gives us the following distribution:</p>

									<h3>3.2 A brief note on error</h3>
									<p>The original suicides and population datasets had columns for upper and lower bounds to compensate for 
										error. However, the decision was made to remove these columns as the upper and lower bounds provided 
										were asymmetric, complicating our ability to take advantage of these error values. Therefore, while 
										we acknowledge the existence of error in the data, they will not be addressed in this study.</p>

								<div class="container">
									<h3>3.3 A brief note on missing values</h3>
									<p>The number of data values per year is inconsistent, due to missing values in the cleaning and merging
										stages of forming the dataset. All rows with missing suicide or population data were dropped as
										they provide no insight into the trends of suicide rates. Additionally, only countries found in both
										the suicides dataset and the happiness dataset were kept. A consequence of this is that data from
										2005 especially is too sparse to accurately represent the behavior of suicide rates in that year, so
										they are also excluded from the final dataset.</p>

									<h2>4. Querying the datasets and extracting views (SQL Server)</h2>
									<p>The cleaned suicides and happiness index datasets were then merged and queried to gain some initial
										insight using SQL, for its ability to work easily with large datasets. SQL allowed us to wrangle the
										data and calculate suicide rates split by age, sex, and both simultaneously, by country. This resulted
										in the following four SQL queries, which split the population by different criteria and calculated the
										corresponding suicide rates:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Suicide Rates by Country</li>
										<li>Suicide Rates by Country and Age</li>
										<li>Suicide Rates by Country and Sex</li>
										<li>Suicide Rates by Country, Age, and Sex</li>
									</ol>
									<p>These queries were then put into views and exported to create our visualizations. This would
										allow us to look at how suicide rates vary from the country level down to how age and sex can affect
										it.</p>

									<p>While suicide rates typically rise with age, these patterns can vary 
										significantly from one country to another. For instance, in countries 
										such as Finland, suicide rates peak between ages 45-59, but 
										for the most part remain relatively even across most ages. Conversely, 
										in countries such as Malaysia, suicide rates appear to increase with age, 
										reaching their highest point at ages 85 and above. Furthermore, countries 
										like Iran show higher rates among young adults compared to other age 
										groups but peak later, around ages 85 and above.</p>
									<p>In many countries, however, suicide rates peak as ages increase for both 
										developed and less-developed countries. Consider the following distribution 
										of peak suicide rates per country:</p>
									<img
										src="images/ages_with_highest_rate_in_countries.PNG"
										alt="Count of age groups with highest suicide rates in each country"
									/>
									<p>Suicide rates in elderly may be higher in less developed countries due to a 
										lack of an adequate healthcare system or support for elderly individuals. 
										On the other hand, social isolation for elderly in developed nations play 
										a role as well due to common societal attitudes. Of course, there are also 
										a number of countries that see their highest suicide rates in the middle aged 
										and in young adults, such as Finland and Thailand. The reality is that these 
										are most likely only a small part of the vast number of unseen factors that play a role.</p>

									<p>Suicide rates for ages 10-14 are substantially lower compared to any other age group (visible in Sections 7.2 and 7.4.1). 
										Mean and median suicide rates were less than 1 death per 100,000 in 2019, with a standard deviation of 0.8.</p>
									<p>Suicide rates for ages 10-14 were also notably lower than rates observed for the

										The above graph shows the relationship between suicide rates of age groups 10-14 and

									<h2>7. A look at suicide rates over time (from 2006-2019)</h2>
									<p>Now, let us consider time as a factor from which to examine suicide rates. Suicides around the 
										world have fluctuated with each passing year, with rates generally having decreased over the past 
										decade. Below are a number of charts showcasing percentage and absolute-changes in suicide rates 
										compared to rates in 2006, for each subsequent year. For example, a percentage change of -16.00% 
										in 2017 means that suicide rates in 2017 were 16.00% lower than in 2006. The year of data shown 
										is adjustable, and both percentage as well as absolute-changes in rates are visible in order to 
										provide clarity on the scale of the data provided. These charts and boxplots are split by countries, 
										age groups, and sex, with data available from 2006-2019.</p>

									<p><b>By 2019, global suicide rates have fallen by over 27% since 2006</b>, equating to around 4.5 deaths 
										per 100,000 population worldwide. Rates have generally decreased with each passing year, although drops 
										in suicide rates have been less pronounced in recent years.</p>
										<script type="module" src="https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/tableau.embedding.3.latest.min.js" ></script>

									<p>On the country level, <b>most countries have experienced a decline in suicide rates since

									<p>It is important to reiterate that it is necessary to consider both the percentage and absolute-changes

										The chart above shows the fluctuations in rates by country, and allows for direct comparisons between 
										them. Note that some countries may contain null values due to incomplete data.</p>
									<p>Changes in suicide rates may differ greatly by country, however. Rates may rise, fall, or fluctuate 
										between years depending on the country. For a visual example, consider the countries of Georgia, 
										Ukraine, and Guatemala in the above chart.</p>

									<p>Suicide rates worldwide for ages 10-14 have barely changed, however, fluctuating between 1-2 deaths

									<p>Rates may also vary greatly between countries and age groups. Countries such as South Korea have

									<p>On a country-level, however, as seen repeatedly above, trends vary greatly. Countries such as

									<h3>8.1 A look at the happiness index</h3>
									<p>Now we would like to investigate whether there is a correlation between our suicide data and the

									<h3>8.2 Acceptable R-squared values in social sciences</h3>
									<p>Before we begin looking at suicide rates and happiness, however, we need to clearly establish what we are looking for with this 
										investigation. As Peterson K. Ozili puts it in his paper on empirical modelling, our objective is not to predict human behaviour 
										but rather to determine if our measures are significant to the trend of suicide rates (Ozili 1). Therefore, for this exploration 
										we will state that a low R-squared value can be acceptable given that our p-values are significant.</p>

								<div class="container">
									<h3>8.3 Suicide Rates and Happiness</h3>
									<p>Below are a series of scatterplots of suicide rates against happiness measures, split by country, age, and gender. However, as seen 
										in previous sections, age group and sex play a significant role in differing suicide rates around the world, and to different 
										degrees depending on country. Therefore, we will primarily focus on suicide rates split by sex and age groups in order to see 
										how each measure affects each split. </p>
									<p>Note: The scatterplots can also be colored by a third happiness measure to look for correlations between two different happiness measures.</p>
									<script type="module" src="https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/tableau.embedding.3.latest.min.js" ></script>
									<tableau-viz id="tableauViz24"       
										src='https://public.tableau.com/views/SuicideRatesStudyAge-Standardized2_0/SuicidesHappinessbyAgeSex?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link'    
										height="40em" width="80vw" hide-tabs>
									</tableau-viz>
									<p>A linear trend line was fitted to the above plot. The following were the most interesting observations:</p>
									<ol>
										<li><b>When plotted against life ladder scores, R-squared values increased with age</b>, with the greatest R-squared values 
											(&#8776; 0.1 to 0.2) appearing between ages 65+ for both men and women. In other words, it is a possibility that as age 
											increases, the overall happiness of a country plays a larger factor in lowering suicide rates.</li>
										<li><b>Similar patterns were observed when charting suicide rates against GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy</b>. 
											In fact, suicide rates seem most correlated to healthy life expectancy than any other measure for ages 65-74, with 
											R-squared values of approximately 0.3. Logically, life expectancy and higher GDP per capita often corresponds to 
											better provision of healthcare and longer periods of healthy living for the elderly, lowering associated risks of suicide.</li>
										<li>For both men and women, <b>social support and suicide rates were positively correlated for younger ages, but 
											negatively correlated for the elderly</b>. Additionally, for women social support was not statistically significant 
											for the younger population, and had weak correlation. Elderly women (65-85) saw the greatest correlation between 
											social support and suicide rates, with R-squared values &#8764;0.1. Conversely, men saw the opposite, with weak 
											correlation at later ages and the strongest for young adults (20-40). This outcome is very interesting, as it 
											implies the following: For elderly women, the presence of friends and family to rely on generally has a greater 
											effect on reducing the risk of suicide. However, for younger men, the presence of people to rely on generally 
											increases the risk of suicide. Of course, with these relatively low R-squared values, this is only one of many 
											factors at play, but it is still interesting nonetheless.</li>
										<li>For the most part, every other happiness measure seem to be significant for most age/gender groupings, although 
											the magnitude of their effect may be much smaller.</li>

									<p>The above boxplots show the distribution of suicide rates for 'happy countries' and 'unhappy countries', respectively. 
										For the sake of simplicity, the dataset was split into two at the median life ladder value. The distributions of 
										suicide rates actually shows that <b>for males under age 50, higher suicide rates are more common among 'happy' countries than among 'unhappy' countries</b>. 
										Median values, 25th and 75th percentiles, and even maximum values (outside of outliers) of suicide rates are greater 
										in the 'happy' set. As age increases beyond that, however, the 'unhappy' set begins to experience a greater proportion 
										of countries with higher suicide rates than the 'happy' set. Women also experience a similar phenomenon, albeit to a 
										much smaller extent.</p>

									<h4>8.5.1 Suicide Rate and Happiness Index trends over time, on a country-level, are unlikely to be highly correlated</h4>
									<script type="module" src="https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/tableau.embedding.3.latest.min.js" ></script>
									<tableau-viz id="tableauViz30"       
										src='https://public.tableau.com/views/SuicideRatesStudyAge-Standardized2_0/SuicidesHappinessTrendsOverTime?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link'    
										height="40em" width="80vw" hide-tabs>
									</tableau-viz>
									<p>The above graph plots suicide rates and a specified happiness measure for a specified country over time. Common 
										trends and patterns between the two would imply the possibility of correlation. If both rise and fall together, 
										this would imply that the two could be related.</p>
									<p>Consider the above, which charts the suicide rates and life ladder scores of South Korean women, ages 30-34, 
										from 2006-2019. The contours of both lines, however, do not seem to follow similar patterns, with suicide rates 
										falling since 2009 while life ladder scores fluctuate greatly. For most countries and measures, the above is 
										the case, however, with even suicide rates between different age groups and sex varying greatly.</p>
									<p>However, it would also be erroneous to confidently say that our happiness measures play no role in affecting 
										suicide rates. It is most likely that they each only play a small role in the larger picture, as is the case 
										most of the time in the study of social sciences.</p>
									<p>Note: The generosity field was normalized for this chart due to the dual axis, and negative numbers affecting 
										its readability. Normalization allows us to scale the values from 0-1, with values representing how generous 
										a country is relative to how generous it should be (according to the WHR), but we lose the information of 
										whether it is more or less generous than it should be. Therefore, this field is normalized for the above chart only.</p>

									<h2>9 Limitations</h2>
									<p>There are many limiting factors to this exploration, as brought up repeatedly above. Each measure plays a role of varying 
										degree depending on age group and gender, not to mention the difficulty to quantify many variables not included in this 
										study. For example, topics such as wealth disparity and easy access to means of suicide may be significant, but are also 
										difficult to quantify.</p>
									<p>There is also the problem that the responses to the Happiness Index measures were not age-separated, meaning that the 
										correlation to suicide rates was based on the national average consensus. Of course, different age groups may respond 
										very differently to their perception of their country. The World Happiness Report state that 
										<a href="https://worldhappiness.report/faq/#:~:text=The%20typical%20annual%20sample%20for,sample%20size%20would%20be%203%2C000.">their sample size for each country is 1,000 people</a>, 
										which they state is a 'reasonably good estimate'. But is it a good representation of each age group?</p>
									<p>However, that also does not mean that the results above are insignificant. Our goal was to find out what 
										factors may simply be part of the equation, in order to provide starting points for how countries may 
										seek to lower suicide rates. We also had to work within the limitations of our two main datasets. 
										Hopefully, as more nations become more aware and educated on the many facets of mental health and suicides, 
										we may gain access to better tools and more accurate data with which we may conduct more practical research.</p>
